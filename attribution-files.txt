Welcome to WEB 425 – Angular with TypeScript.  During week 1 we will be exploring the Angular CLI, Components, TypeScript, and Modules.  As a friendly reminder, all Angular Components, Services, Directives, Routers, Modules, etc. must include code attribution.

Files requiring code attribution:
•    <name>.component.ts,
•    <name>.service.ts,
•    <name>.module.ts,
•    <name>.directive.ts
•    <name>.routing.ts

If you have any questions please do not hesitate to ask!
